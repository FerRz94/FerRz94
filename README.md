### Hi, i'm Fernando Ruiz ðŸ‘‹

Before getting to know and becoming interested in studying at Soy Henry, I graduated and worked as a physical education teacher.
When starting my career at Henry Bootcamp, I didn't have any knowledge in technology beyond daily use as a user. This posed a challenge for me to learn many technologies that I was previously unfamiliar with and therefore required me to dedicate more time to learning them.
After researching, studying, and practicing, I was able to learn these technologies in the development projects that I was going to undertake.
My goal is to continue learning and developing my skills to keep progressing in creating innovative content that helps clients have a better web experience.
